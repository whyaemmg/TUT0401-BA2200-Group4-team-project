## Project Description
CocktailCraft is an application for discovering, customizing, and managing cocktail recipes. It allows users to search and filter cocktails, personalize ingredients and quantities, save favourites, rate drinks, and receive recommendations based on the ingredients they have available.
### Domain
- food: drinks
---
## User Stories
### User Story 1 [Qinli]
As a user, I want to search for cocktails by name and filter them by base spirit, flavour profile, and carbonation so that I can easily find drinks that match my preferences.
### User Story 2 [Enhao]
As a user, I want to customize existing cocktail recipes by adding, removing, or replacing ingredients and adjusting quantities so that I can make drinks according to my personal preferences.
### User Story 3 [Jiaqi]
As a user, I want to save my favourite cocktails, rate them, and add personal notes so that I can keep track of drinks I enjoy and revisit their recipes later.
### User Story 4 [Wenqian]
As a user, I want to enter the ingredients I currently have and receive cocktail recommendations based on them so that I can discover drinks I like and can make with purchasing minimum additional ingredients.

## Use Cases
### Use Case 1 [Qinli]
Inputs
* Cocktail name: A text field where the user types a cocktail name.
* Base spirit: A dropdown with the options: Gin, Vodka, Rum, Tequila, Whiskey, Brandy, and Other.
  
Input requirement
The user must enter a cocktail name or select a specific base spirit, or both. The user can select multiple base spirits at a time, and the system would return (if exist) any cocktail that contains at least one of the base spirit.

Normal Flow
1. The user enters a cocktail name and/or selects the base spirit(s).
2. The user clicks Search.
3. The system searches for cocktails that match all provided criteria. Name matching is case-insensitive and allows partial matches.
4. The system displays the matching cocktail names in a results list.
   
Alternative Flows
* If the name is blank and there is no selected base spirit, the system displays: “Please enter a cocktail name or select a base spirit.”
* If no cocktails match, the system displays: “No cocktails found.”
* If the API request fails, the system displays an error message and allows the user to retry.

### Use Case 2 [Enhao]
Input
1) An existing cocktail recipe selected by the user.
2) Ingredient names, quantities, and units.
3) A name for a customized recipe

Normal Flow
1) The user selects an existing cocktail recipe and clicks Customize.
2) The system displays the recipe's ingredients, quantities, and units.
3) The user adds, removes, or replaces ingredients and adjusts quantities.
4) The user enters a name for a customized recipe and clicks Save.
5) The system validates the input.
6) The system saves the customized recipe separately from the original and displays the saved recipe.

Alternative Flows
1) If the recipe name or an ingredient name is blank, the system asks the user to enter the missing information.
2) If a quantity is not a positive number or a unit is missing, the system asks the user to enter a valid quantity and unit.
3) If all ingredients have been removed, the system displays: “Please add at least one ingredient.”
4) If saving fails, the system displays an error message and allows the user to retry.
5) If the user clicks Cancel, the system discards the changes and returns to the original recipe.

### Use Case 3 [Jiaqi]
